# Introduction

### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Ik Teng Liaw.
I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a passion for solving complex problems using technology. With a strong background in Python, machine learning, data analysis, and software development, I thrive in environments that encourage creativity and collaboration.

I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to make a positive impact through innovation. Whether itâ€™s building cutting-edge machine learning models, designing intuitive web applications, or analyzing data to uncover valuable insights, I always aim to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

Beyond coding, I enjoy photography and gaming, which keep me inspired and help me stay balanced. I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects that make a real difference.
