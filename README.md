# 👋 Hello, I'm Ik Teng Liaw!

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a passion for building impactful, data-driven solutions. I enjoy working at the intersection of machine learning, software development, and human-centered design.

I have hands-on experience in designing full-stack platforms, training AI models, and developing tools that extract meaningful insights from complex data. Whether it’s a deep learning pipeline, a real-time application, or a predictive analytics dashboard, I aim to combine technical excellence with user-centric thinking.

Beyond coding, I enjoy photography, gaming, and learning new tools to express creativity. I'm always open to meaningful collaborations and opportunities to grow.

## 🧠 Projects

### [Customer Churn Prediction Platform](https://github.com/ACarrig/NUUMobile1) – UW–Madison Capstone  
A full-stack platform (React + Flask) that allows multi-file uploads, real-time churn predictions, and AI-driven insights.

### [Pneumonia Detection using DenseNet](https://github.com/ikteng/RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Project)  
Built a DenseNet model to classify pneumonia from X-rays with 85% accuracy. Handled DICOM preprocessing and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.

### [IMDb Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ikteng/Movie_Reviews)  
Used Naive Bayes and deep learning to classify movie reviews as positive/negative, achieving over 85% accuracy.

### [Age & Gender Predictor](https://github.com/ikteng/Age-and-Gender-Predictor)  
Developed a real-time webcam app using CNN models, PyTorch, and OpenCV to predict age and gender from facial images.
